## As we can see, I'm just using github to host my own site, coz I need it for school

I don't have much to comment about because as you can see. This is just my own private site for school, I don't even know how you found it but who cares.

### What I do

I live around degenerative social media sites like reddit, mostly lurking around topics that revolve around the PS Vita since I have good amount of knowledge when it comes to accidentally causing issues with it and fixing it.

### Support or Contact

Don't ever contact me unless it's very important.
